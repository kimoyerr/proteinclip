# ProteinCLIP

## Introduction and background

## Installation

To install proteinCLIP, start by cloning this repository. Then, create the requisite conda environment, activate it, and install ProteinCLIP in **editable mode** using pip. For example:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate proteinclip
pip install -e ./
```

Note: we highly recommend the [mamba package manager](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) as an alternative to conda. 

In addition to installation, you will likely need to download data files if you intend to train ProteinCLIP yourself; all datasets we use can be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11176863). 

## Example training commands

### Training ProteinCLIP

To train ProteinCLIP yourself, you can use the pre-computed embeddings that we have provided above, or you can compute your own embeddings stored in a hdf5 format as (uniprot ID -> embedding array). After you have obtained a protein embedding file, pass it to training script as follows:

Example command:
```bash
python bin/train_protein_clip.py configs/clip_hparams.json /path/to/uniprot_sprot.dat.gz /path/to/protein_embedding.hdf5 --unitnorm -g text-embedding-3-large
```

### Training protein-protein interaction classifier

We provide a training command to automatically train a protein-protein classifier using the data splits provided by Bernett et al. The input to this training call is a directory to a training run of the above ProteinCLIP; the relevant hdf5 embeddings for proteins will be loaded, as well as the CLIP architecture itself (as specified by the `--clipnum` argument). 

Example command:
```bash
python bin/train_ppi.py configs/supervised_hparams.json -c ./protein_clip/version_0 --clipnum 1 -n ppi_classifier
```
